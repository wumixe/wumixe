### Hello!

I'm Tristan, also known as Wumixe online.

I am wanting to learn software development, which is why I
am here on GitHub!

I want to contribute to open-source software and eventually
make software of my own.

I am a Linux user; [I](https://www.debian.org/) [have](https://linuxmint.com) 
[been](https://fedoraproject.org) [hopping](https://archlinux.org) 
[between](https://www.opensuse.org/) [distributions](https://voidlinux.org)
for a while now.

In my spare time, I enjoy swimming and playing video games. 

Some of my favorites are Minecraft and Team Fortress 2.
